-------------Part 1 Questions-------------
5.1) No, because Scanner does not assign any additional responsibilities to what it has read. Scanner only reads them.

6.1) The methods byteValue() and shortValue() serve to return a casted version of whatever the method intValue() returns. Because of this, the methods are already defined, since intValue() would already be defined. 

7.1) Class uses this object to check if a method returns void. Although there is no void type, void represents a placeholder for any actual type that the method is using. 

9.2) A thread that sleeps by calling ‘sleep’ won’t do anything for a given time, while a thread that awaits by calling ‘await’ is waiting for something else to finish before it continues- when it starts and how long it should wait before it starts is dependent on the something else that needs to be done before it. 

9.3) The thread will simply wait forever.
