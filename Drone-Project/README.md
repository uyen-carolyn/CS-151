# CS151 Drone Project

Reminders: 

- Current bullet collision detection is scuffed, works fine for a alpha/beta version

What's Left:

- Figure out what "drone has a fixed speed when the user is not using the keys to move it" means
- Bug testing

Everything including the "additional implementation" items is completed in some form.
There is an executable Jar located in the out/artifacts folder
